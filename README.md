# Concurrent Requests Test
Load your website with a number of concurrent requests and check how many of them the website will handle properly, and how many will fail.

# Usage
Simply upload the file to your website and open it in a browser.
You will be able to specify the following settings:
1. How many dummy requests to send.
2. How long to wait for requests to return some response.
3. How many times to run the test.

The current status of each request will be shown in a scrollable log, and after each run, the failed requests will be displayed in a graph.
